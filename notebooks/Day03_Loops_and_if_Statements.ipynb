    "\n",
    "Yesterday, we went over the important basics for coding languages, and we will be building off of them today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things we learned yesterday\n",
    "* How to define a variable\n",
    "* Boolean values that return a true or false\n",
    "* Indexing a list, changing lists\n",
    "* Using keys to call information from a dictionary\n",
    "* What built in functions are\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will be going over these tools that make automating your research easier. These tools are similar across coding languages as well. The first thing we will go through is `for loops`, which allow you to perform a process many times very quickly. \n",
    "The next thing we will be going through is `if statements`. These allow you to check conditions of interest, and then perform actions depending on whether they are true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals for the day\n",
    "* Go over Jupyter notebooks a little more in depth\n",
    "* Learn more about floating points\n",
    "* Go over an introduction to for loops\n",
    "* Begin using if/else statements\n",
    "* Learn elif statements\n",

It's important to understand why this `NaN` is in your data before proceeding, so you can ask your questions like:\n",
