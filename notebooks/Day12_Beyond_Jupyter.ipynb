    "# To Jupyter... And Beyond!\n",
    "**Start the day with students looking at my screen. They will open their own screens in part 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "## A typical project workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps are only loosely chronological. Usually, these are all happening at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **An idea**\n",
    "    - e.g. \"If big black holes are formed from smaller black holes, more massive black holes would spin faster. I think more massive black holes spin faster than less massive black holes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exploratory plots in a jupyter notebook:** \n",
    "    - Most analyses start in a jupyter notebook, just like the ones we've been using in class. \n",
    "    - Yay! The comfort of familiarity. You usually start with the lines you know and love: \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib as plt\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "    - Exploration often happens with a small subset of your data to make playing around manageable. \n",
    "    - e.g. take only 50 black hole observations (rather than 1000s) and make a quick-and dirty plot via\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "data = pd.load_csv('black_holes.csv')[:50]\n",
    "data.plot.scatter(x='mass',y='spin')\n",
    "```\n",
    "    - Iteration is a necessary part of this process! Your first idea will rarely be your best one.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Develop robust analysis**\n",
    "    - Take your explorations and try to prove your ideas right or wrong using ~ statistics ~\n",
    "    - \"Hm, mass and spin don't seem correlated, can I show that their non-correlation is statistically significant?\"\n",
    "4. **Automate analysis (outside of the notebook)**\n",
    "    - This allows you scale your analysis up to larger datasets, makes it more portable so you can use it on a cluster, and makes it more useable by others.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. **Make pretty plots and write a paper**\n",
    "    - Yay!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is to help with step 4. Today, we will teach you what you need to know to run python outside of these class notebooks. As a result, today's notebook will serve as more of an outline than a workbook. We will come here periodically, but most of the class will be following along on your computer as the instrutors write code live. Today will also be more interactive, with instructors looking for answers from in-person students. We will cover:\n",

After that, we will move on to simple text editors. Then, we will go to jupyter hub, which is basically a jupyter notebook. Not so scary after all!"

    "## The Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line is kind of like a much more powerful Finder, but you have to type everything instead of clicking. You can move files, copy them, create them, rename them, move between folders, create them, rename them. In the command line, you can launch any application you want, open any file you want, search for files, search for strings in files, and much more. Think of it as a way to speak more directly to your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line is a very powerful interface for your computer, but it is also a universal interface for all Unix-based computers (Macs and PCs running Linux or other Unix operating systems, but not Windows machines). Therefore, the command line is how you will interact with computing clusters/supercomputers. Most clusters don't have a way to control them graphically (i.e. by clicking on things). Instead, they just have a command line interface. Even if they do have a graphical interface, its usually very cumbersome, slow, and limited. Therefore, learning command line syntax is the way to go. Therefore, when you eventually scale up your code to use clusters, you might find it helpful to come back to this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The languages most commonly used on the command line are `bash` and `zsh`. They are very similar, and for our intents and purposes, they are the same. I'll probably just refer to both of them as `bash`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commands you know and love\n",
    "Let's start with the usual commands we do every day. Open a new terminal window and type the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd <your_path>/intro-programming-2022 \n",
    "```\n",
    "`cd` means \"change directory\". So this command changed our directory from wherever the terminal started to your intro programming directory. Here, the _command_ is `cd` and the _argument_ is the path you would like to navigate to. \n",
    "```\n",
    "git pull\n",
    "```\n",
    "Git is a software installed on your computer, like python or microsoft word. This line says \"run the software called git. Now that you know I'm talking to the software called git, I want you to specifically run the part of the software that pulls modifications from an online repository to my local version\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd notebooks\n",
    "```\n",
    "Again, change directories. This time, we move to the `notebooks` directory.\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "Jupyter is another software installed on your computer. This line says \"run the software called jupyter, and specifically run the notebook part of that software.\" Now, Open today's notebook and give a green check ✅ when you're ready.\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    ls\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Here, `ls` stands for \"list\". You should see listed all the contents of the `notebooks` directory, where we currently are. Check that, in addition to all of the notebooks we've used so far, you see `my_directory`.\n",

    "``` \n",
    "mv my_file.txt my_cool_file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `mv` means \"move\". This command moves contents of files to new locations. In this case, the new location was the same directory but inside a file with a different name. Check it worked by running `ls`. Double check by running `open my_cool_file.txt`. Give a ✅ when you've confirmed your change.\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    This downloads the file and displays it. But if we want to save the file on our computer, we will use the `-o` option and specify a file. We will save the data to a file called \"RnD.csv\" in the output directory.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    curl -o ../output/RnD.csv https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Research-and-development-survey/Research-and-development-survey-2021/Download-data/Research-and-development-survey-2021-CSV-notes.csv\n",

    "    \n",
    "    - Give a ✅ when you see your new file.\n",
    "1. Find files using `find`\n",
    "    - Finally! A command named something that makes sense. This is used when I'm looking for a file but I don't know where it is on my computer. Check out the documetation [here](https://linux.die.net/man/1/find).\n",
    "    - The general form is: `find <starting directory> <matching criteria and actions>`\n",
    "    - So, if we want to find all `txt` files in the \"output\" directory, we can do \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    find ../output -name \"*.txt\" -print\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    The first argument is the place to look for your files (here, it was `../output`) then, its all optional arguments. These are a lot like keyword arguments in python. The first optional argument is `-name` which accepts a pattern. This is the pattern we are searching for (here, it was `\"*.txt\"` where we used `*` as a wildcard. The second optional argument is `-print`, which tells find to print the output of its search. Try to run the command.\n",
    "    - Give a ✅ when you've found your files.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Find contents in files using `grep`\n",
    "    - Syntax: `grep <string to search for> <options> <starting directory>`\n",
    "    - Look for all lines in all files that have the string \"Huron\", starting one level up, and going \"recusrively\" through all directoryies under our starting directory:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    grep \"Huron\" -r ../\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "It is very useful to keep a small text file (or other set of notes) of useful commands. Unlike `python`, `bash` and `zsh` don't have very intuitive syntax or naming conventions, so it can be hard to memorize their commands. Katie, Maria, and Amanda all keep a short list of useful commands, especially ones with confusing syntax, along with explanations of how to use them."

    "Follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Open a new terminal tab or window\n",
    "2. Navigate to your working directory, like we do every day. We will work out of the `notebooks` directory.\n",
    "3. Type `python`\n",
    "    - Your terminal should display something similar to the following:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Python 3.8.5 (default, Sep  4 2020, 02:22:02) \n",
    "    [Clang 10.0.0 ] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin\n",
    "    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    - If it displays `Python 3.X`, where `X` is any value, you are good!\n",
    "    - If it displays `Python 2.Y` for any value of Y, type `exit()` and press enter. Then type `python3`. Ask a TA if this doesn't work.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. You are now running python interactively! Let's try a few things out to see how interactive python works.\n",
    "    - Type a print statement with a string as the argument to `print()`. Press enter\n",
    "    - Type a mathematical expression (e.g. `1+1`) and press enter\n",
    "    - Notice that inputs are always on lines denoted by `>>>` or `...` and outputs start newlines without these characters.\n",
    "5. Let's try some more nuanced commands that we are used to using on Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "    - Try some of our usual imports (e.g. `import numpy as np`, then try `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`)\n",
    "    - Define a variable, calling it whatever you want and giving it whatever value you want, using any datatype you want. Press enter.\n",
    "    - Type the variable's name. Press enter.\n",
    "5. Now let's try some code we've seen before to see what happens in interactive mode.\n",
    "    - First, I'll copy some things from Day 2, where we had some fun with lists. Start by replicating the following line in your terminal, then follow along with the instructor. Try to predict what will happen with each line before pressing enter.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'squid', 'moose', 'falcon']\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - Now, we will try some things using `pandas`. Remember, to use a package we need to import it first. We haven't imported `pandas` yet, so lets do that now.\n",
    "    - We're going to load in some data that we used earlier. This data is stored in a csv format. I don't quite remember the syntax for the `pandas` function for this, but we don't want to leave the terminal because that's a lot of work, so lets try the built in `help()` function. \n",
    "    - It works very similarly to using it in jupyter! you can even scroll. However, there's no buttons to close out of the viewing mode once you're in it, so you'll have to type `q` to leave after you've read everything you need.\n",
    "    - You can re-run the same line without having to re-type the whole thing by using the \"up\" button on your keyboard.\n",
    "    - Looking at the docstring, it seems like the first argument is the file name, and all other arguments are optional. the default delimiter is `,`, which is exactly what we want, so we can just go with default behavior.\n",
    "    - Load in the file but don't assign it to a variable. You'll have to figure out the path. The file's name is `Pokemon.csv` and it is in the `data` directory. \n",
    "    - You should see the column names as well as the first and last 5 rows of data.\n",
    "    - Now load in the file but this time assign it to a variable. I'll call my variable `data`. Notice how there's no output now.\n",
    "    - _**Coding check-in:**_ Play around with your dataframe. How many Pokemon have Grass as their first type? What's the mean attack value?\n",
    "6. How does plotting work?\n",
    "    - With our nice graphical user interface (GUI) gone, we're stuck with a very basic looking screen that doesn't seem like it has support for the beautiful plots you've learned how to make. What happens when you try to make a plot?\n",
    "    - We've already imported `matplotlib` and `numpy`, so we have all the libraries we need for a simple plot. \n",
    "    - Make an array full of increasing `float` values.\n",
    "    - Plot the square of that array vs the array itself.\n",
    "    - you might get taken away from the terminal for seemingly no reason. There is a reason, just go back to the terminal for now.\n",
    "    - Run `plt.show()`. A plot should pop up.\n",
    "    - You must close your plot to have access to the command line again.\n",
    "7. Functions\n",
    "    - Write a simple \"hello world!\" function.\n",
    "    - You have to provide your own indentation in interactive python. Otherwise you will get the dreaded `IndentationError: expected an indented block`!\n",
    "    - An empty newline indicates you're done writing the function. \n",
    "    - `...` indicates being inside an indented block, `>>>` indicates being outside of it\n",
    "    - Call your function.\n",
    "    - Write a function that takes in one argument, applies something to it, and returns a new value.\n",

Because of their simplicity, You can easily send collaborators little snippets of code or long scripts (via github or similar services) in the `.py` format, wheras jupyter notebooks are really just too bulky to be sent around. Collaborating with others on a project is also basically impossible with jupyter notebooks, but is really straightforward with the `.py` file format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the `.py` format allows you to use the same code over and over again in different projects without having to copy and paste that code into all of your notebooks. Imagine if every time you wanted to use a function from `numpy`, you had to copy all 770,945 lines of the source code into your jupyter notebook! That would suck, especially because half of the numpy code is actually in `C`, a completely different programming language that jupyter doesn't know how to deal with. We don't have to do this because `numpy` has been made into a [library](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-python-intro/06-libraries/index.html). Now we will show you how to use the `.py` format to create your own libraries and [modules](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/working-with-modules-in-python-must-known-fundamentals-for-data-scientists/#What-are-Python-Modules?). (A library is a collection of modules. A module is a `.py` file.)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a **new** file in BBEdit or your preferred text editor.\n",
    "2. Add the python shebang.\n",
    "3. Write a function named `adder` that takes in two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env python3\n",
    "def adder(x,y):\n",
    "    return x+y\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Save your new file: give it a `.py` extension and put it in the `notebooks` directory. Name it whatever you want, but make sure there are no spaces and no special characters (besides underscore `_`)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Go back to your terminal and fire up a new interactive session in your `notebooks` directory by typing `python` (or `python3`, depending on what you had to do before).\n",
    "6. Try to use your function: type `adder(5,6)`. What output do you get?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Just like we do with our other libraries, we need to import our module to use its contents. Try `import <your_script_name>` but replace \"`<your_script_name>`\" with your actual script name. **Do not include .py**\n",
    "8. Now try to use your function, similarly to how you use functions from other modules: `<your_script_name>.adder(5,6)`. Again, replace \"`<your_script_name>`\" with your actual script name. Ask TAs if this step doesn't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Writing the module name before the function you want to use can be tiresome sometimes, especially when you only want a few functions from your module. Try this instead:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> from <your_script_name> import adder\n",
    ">>> adder(5,6)\n",
    "11\n",
    "```\n",
    "Pretty nifty, right?\n",
    "10. Import your module into this notebook and then try to run `adder` in the cells below."

    "The reason for this behavior is the same reason why interactive python and jupyter notebooks work in the first place.\n",
    "In order to provide users with an interactive experience, modules remain \"alive\" even when they are not being actively called. (This is opposed to other \"compiled\" languages like C and fortran, which aren't capable of running interactively in the style we've used in this course.) For example, a numpy array doesn't get erased from one cell of a jupyter notebook to another. Instead, it remains alive in your kernel. The same is true for modules. When you re-import a module, python sees the line and recognizes the module since the module is still alive in the kernel. Because of this, it doesn't re-read the files associated with the module since it thinks its already read them. Thus, changes aren't effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to get the changes we made, we need to restart the kernel and re-run the cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "14. Restart your kernel.\n",
    "15. Re-run your import and usage cells. Does your function call cause a print statement now?\n",
    "16. Restarting your kernel every time can be somewhat annoying. Here's a workaround for notebooks to manually force python to re-read all modules when they are loaded in a second time. \n",
    "    1. Run the below cell\n",
    "    1. Edit your `adder()` function in the text editor to have it print out a different string.\n",
